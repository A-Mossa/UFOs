# UFOs

## Overview of Project:
My acquaintaince data journalist Dana has reached out to me to help her create a webapp to manipulate a dataset on UFO sightings across the United States. She gathered the dataset and requires my help formating the web page into an easily saearchable table for people to find the information they wanted.

### Results:
After a long session of coding in Javascript and Html, Dana and Myself were able to establish a user-friendly WebApp for her project. The page included a note from Dr. Ursula F. Olivier, who is a subject matter expert in the field, on her view on the subject. A data filter was also implemented in the form of a table with multiple filter to ease the searching process.

### Summary:
- One Drawback to the webpage was that the dataset feeding it was rather weak with no ability to add to it.

- My recommendations:
  - First I'd like to advise Dana that we should add user feedback section with support for images, as the webpage can grow in data and popularity by implementing a feedback mechanism by visitors.
  - My second recommendation would be to make the database dynamic, in order for the website to continue to grow over time.
